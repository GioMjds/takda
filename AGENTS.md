## 1. What is Takda?

Takda is a **queue and appointment booking platform for walk-in businesses**
targeted at the informal service economy — palengke (public market) stalls,
barbershops, small dental/optical clinics, LGU (local government unit)
offices, and the like.

**Core flow:**

1. A business owner registers and configures their **capacity / slots**
   (e.g. "30 slots per day, 1 slot every 5 minutes, open 8am–5pm").
2. Customers **scan a QR code** at the storefront (or open a shared link).
3. The customer picks a slot, enters a name + phone number, and books.
4. The system sends a **SMS reminder** before the slot.
5. The owner sees a **live queue** for the day, can mark arrivals,
   no-shows, and walk-ins.

**Why this product, not Calendly / Square Appointments:**
those tools are designed for scheduled professional services in Western
markets (one booking = one paid appointment, far in advance). Takda targets
high-volume, low-friction, same-day, walk-in-heavy businesses where the
queue itself is the product.

**Non-goals (do not add these without a discussion):**

- native mobile apps — customers use the PWA / web link
- payments / tipping (out of scope for v1)
- multi-tenant SaaS billing flows (we are a single-tenant-per-deployment
  product, multi-business per tenant)

Workspaces are wired through `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`apps/*` + `packages/*`)
and orchestrated by **Turborepo**.

### Module names (use these in code, not `apps/web`)

| Workspace         | Package name    | Imported as                           |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `apps/web`        | `@takda/web`    | (Next app, not imported)              |
| `apps/api`        | `@takda/api`    | (Nest app, not imported)              |
| `packages/shared` | `@takda/shared` | `import { ... } from '@takda/shared'` |

The `@takda/shared` path alias is defined in the root `tsconfig.json` and
re-declared in each app's `tsconfig.json`. Add new shared exports there.

## 4. Universal rules (apply in every workspace)

### 4.1 TypeScript

- `strict: true` is on. No `any`, no `// @ts-ignore`. Use `unknown` and narrow.
- Prefer `type` over `interface` for plain data shapes; use `interface` for
  classes and NestJS DI tokens.
- Imports of `@takda/shared` go through the alias, never via relative path.
- Do not add new top-level dependencies without first checking the root
  `package.json`. If it must live in only one app, add it to that app's
  `package.json` — not the root.

### 4.2 Code style

- Prettier config is the source of truth. Don't fight it. Run
  `pnpm exec prettier --write .` before committing.
- 2-space indent, single quotes, trailing commas, LF line endings.
- File names: `kebab-case.ts` for regular files, `PascalCase.tsx` for React
  components (Next.js convention).
- One responsibility per file. If a file passes 300 lines, it almost
  certainly needs to be split.

### 4.3 Git

- Branch names: `<type>/<short-kebab-summary>` — e.g.
  `feat/owner-dashboard`, `fix/sms-reminder-dedupe`.
- Commit messages: imperative mood, ≤72-char subject, body explains _why_.
  Reference the issue / ticket ID when one exists.
- Don't commit `.env*` files. They are in `.gitignore`; keep them that way.
- Don't commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` churn from a one-off `pnpm add` you didn't
  mean to keep — review the diff before staging.

### 4.4 Definition of done (any non-trivial change)

A change is "done" only when **all** of these are true:

1. It builds: `pnpm build` at the root passes.
2. It typechecks: `pnpm typecheck` (or the app's own script) passes.
3. It lints: `pnpm lint` passes for the touched workspace(s).
4. It has tests for behavior it adds or changes (see §5).
5. It does not regress an existing test, typecheck, or build.
6. It does not introduce a TODO without an owner and a target date.

### 4.5 Workspace execution rules

- **Do not use root `turbo` scripts** if working in a specific workspace (e.g., `web`, `api`, `shared`) to run bash or any other scripting commands. Navigate to that workspace or run workspace-specific commands directly via pnpm (e.g. `pnpm --filter @takda/web <command>` or run command inside the workspace directory).

### 4.6 Next.js (App Router) & Web Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns via `apps/web/views/<route-name>`**: Next.js App Router routing files (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `template.tsx`) in `apps/web/app/` should remain thin wrappers that import their core presentation and state components from `apps/web/views/<route-name>/`.
  - **Why `views/` and not `pages/`**: Next.js reserves a workspace-root `pages/` directory for the legacy Pages Router and turns every non-underscore file inside it into a route — which collides head-on with the App Router in `app/`. This presentation layer is therefore named `views/`. Do not name it `pages/`.
  - Inside `apps/web/views/<route-name>/`, structure directories as:
    - `hooks/`: Page-specific custom hooks (e.g., form handlers, RHF setup, state hooks).
    - `api/`: API call files incorporating `apps/web/configs/fetch.ts`, named after the HTTP method (e.g., `GET.ts`, `POST.ts`, `PUT.ts`, `DELETE.ts`).
    - `sections/`: UI layout sections and sub-components specific to this route.
    - `index.ts`: Barrel file exporting views, custom hooks, and sections.
  - Map route paths declared in `apps/web/app` to their `views` equivalent:
    - `app/[lang]/page.tsx` $\rightarrow$ `views/[lang]/`
    - `app/[lang]/(auth)/login/page.tsx` $\rightarrow$ `views/[lang]/login/`
    - `app/[lang]/(customer)/b/[businessSlug]/page.tsx` $\rightarrow$ `views/[lang]/b/[businessSlug]/`
    - `app/[lang]/(customer)/b/[businessSlug]/confirm/page.tsx` $\rightarrow$ `views/[lang]/b/[businessSlug]/confirm/`
    - `app/[lang]/(onboarding)/onboarding/page.tsx` $\rightarrow$ `views/[lang]/onboarding/`
    - `app/[lang]/(owner)/dashboard/page.tsx` $\rightarrow$ `views/[lang]/dashboard/`

- **Typecheck & Typed Routes**: Always run typecheck (`pnpm typecheck` inside `apps/web`) to validate typed routes and link path correctness.

- **Props Typing**: Always type page files using the globally available `PageProps<TRoute>` and layout files using `LayoutProps<TRoute>`. Next.js typegen automatically infers parameters and searchParams from the route path provided as the generic argument.
  - Due to Next.js 15/16 rendering updates, `params` and `searchParams` are async and must be awaited before accessing:
    ```typescript
    // Example for app/[lang]/page.tsx
    export default async function HomePage({ params }: PageProps<'/[lang]'>) {
      const { lang } = await params;
      // ...
    }

    // Example for app/[lang]/layout.tsx
    export default async function RootLayout({
      children,
      params,
    }: LayoutProps<'/[lang]'>) {
      const { lang } = await params;
      // ...
    }
    ```
  - Map dynamic routes correctly by omitting route grouping folders from the route path argument (e.g., `PageProps<'/[lang]/login'>` for `app/[lang]/(auth)/login/page.tsx` and `PageProps<'/[lang]/b/[businessSlug]'>` for `app/[lang]/(customer)/b/[businessSlug]/page.tsx`).

- **Route Grouping**: Prioritize route grouping (`(auth)`, `(customer)`, `(owner)`) for different layouts and page routing structures. Always create a `layout.tsx` file inside any newly created route group folder.

- **Template Files (`template.tsx`)**: Use `template.tsx` only when you need Next.js to recreate the component instance on route navigation (e.g. to trigger entrance/exit animations with Framer Motion, reset local state, or run a `useEffect` hook on every transition). Otherwise, prefer persistent `layout.tsx` files.

- **Loading States (`loading.tsx`)**: Implement `loading.tsx` at key route levels to leverage React Streaming. Skeletons must be styled using **shadcn's Skeleton UI** primitives instead of spinner/fallback placeholders to match layout dimensions and reduce cumulative layout shift.

- **Not Found Handling (`not-found.tsx`)**: Provide `not-found.tsx` components in dynamic routes (e.g., `[businessSlug]`). Trigger these by calling Next.js's native `notFound()` function when a resource dynamic segment is invalid or database lookups return null.

- **Dynamic Segments**: Ensure proper type validation of dynamic route segments in `PageProps` and strictly validate segment variables server-side using `@takda/shared` schemas.

- **Intercepting Routes**: Implement intercepting routes (e.g., `(.)` relative or `(..)` parent segment directories) to load modal dialogues (e.g., slot selection or quick owner actions) while keeping the background context intact and retaining shareable URLs.

- **Parallel Routes**: Use parallel route slots (e.g., `@modal`, `@tabs`) inside a layout file to render multiple views concurrently or conditionally in the same workspace layout.

- **Link & Image Optimization**:
  - Always use `next/image` with responsive `sizes` (e.g., `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 33vw"`) and preset aspect-ratio configurations to avoid layout shifts.
  - Use `loading="lazy"` (Next.js default) for below-the-fold images to defer non-critical assets.
  - Use the `priority` attribute explicitly for above-the-fold elements (such as hero graphics or logo assets) to boost LCP scores.
  - Utilize `placeholder="blur"` (with static imports or a `blurDataURL` for dynamic assets) to deliver a polished visual loading state.
  - Always supply meaningful, screen-reader-friendly `alt` descriptions (avoid redundant words like "image" or "logo").
  - Always use `next/link` for internal transitions and ensure typed routing configs (`experimental.typedRoutes`) are active and valid.

- **SEO, Semantic HTML & Accessibility (ARIA)**:
  - Structural blocks must use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`).
  - Maintain a single `<h1>` per page for search engine crawlers, preserving sequential, non-skipping heading flows (`<h2>` to `<h6>`).
  - Implement descriptive ARIA properties to expose active elements and states to screen readers (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-expanded` for toggles, and `aria-live="polite"`/`role="status"` for dynamic updates like queue statuses).

- **Directives Constraints**:
  - `'use client'`: Mark files containing hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), event handlers, browser APIs, or animation libraries (e.g., `motion`).
  - `'use server'`: Restrict only to files or functions serving as entry points for Server Actions. Do not mix server actions inside client component files.
  - `'use cache'`: Utilize at database query or expensive calculation boundaries to cache server-rendered properties.
  - **Server-Side vs. Client-Side Page Components**: To ensure maximum SEO indexability and fast page loads, the main route page (`page.tsx`) and the top-level route barrel file (`views/<route-name>/index.ts`) must remain **Server Components** by default.
  - **Integrating Animations & Transitions**: If a page requires transitions, page entrance animations, or hover micro-interactions via `motion`:
    - Do not mark the entire page as a Client Component.
    - Encapsulate the animated portions inside specific child components within `views/<route-name>/sections/` and mark _only_ those sub-components with `'use client'`.
    - Import these animated sub-components back into the parent Server Component. This retains the semantic SEO structure on the initial server render while cleanly applying client-side animations after hydration.

## 5. Testing

- **Unit tests** live next to the code (`*.spec.ts` for Nest, `*.test.ts`
  for shared/utility code, `*.test.tsx` for React components).
- **Integration tests** for the API live in `apps/api/test/`.
- A change without a test for new behavior will be sent back. The test
  does not need to be elaborate; even a "happy path + one failure mode"
  is enough for a first pass.
- Tests must run in CI without network calls. Mock SMS, Redis, and the DB
  in unit tests. Use the test DB only in `test:e2e`.

---

## 6. Domain model (the language we use)

These terms mean the same thing everywhere. Don't invent synonyms.

- **Tenant** — one deployment of Takda. (For v1, we ship one tenant per
  deployment; later this becomes "organization".)
- **Business** — a single walk-in business inside a tenant. The owner logs
  in here, the QR code points here.
- **Service** — a bookable offering of the business (e.g. "Haircut",
  "Stall #3 dry goods pickup"). A business has 1..N services.
- **Slot** — a single bookable unit of capacity for a service at a time.
- **Booking** — a customer's reservation of one slot. Has a `status`:
  `pending` → `confirmed` → `checked_in` / `no_show` / `cancelled`.
- **Queue position** — derived: the customer's ordinal position among
  today's `confirmed` bookings for a business, sorted by slot start time.
- **Reminder** — a scheduled SMS job tied to a booking, sent T-X minutes
  before the slot.
- **Walk-in** — a customer served without a booking; the owner adds them
  to the queue manually so capacity tracking stays honest.

All of these have Zod schemas in `packages/shared` and Prisma models in
`apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`. The Zod schema is the API contract; the
Prisma model is the storage contract; do not let them drift silently.

---

## 7. Cross-workspace contract

- `packages/shared` is the **only** workspace other code may import from
  by name. (`@takda/web` and `@takda/api` may not import each other.)
- Anything exported from `@takda/shared` must be **tree-shakeable** and
  must not pull in Node-only or browser-only modules at the top level.
  If a util needs Node APIs, put it behind a `*.server.ts` or `*.client.ts`
  suffix and document which side may import it.
- **Bumping the shared contract is a breaking change** for the API and the
  web together. Update both in the same PR.

---

## 8. Environment & secrets

- Local dev: copy `.env.example` (if present) to `.env` in each app.
  Real secrets never go in the repo.
- Required services in dev: Postgres, Redis, an SMS provider key.
- The API reads `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and the SMS
  provider key from `process.env`. The web reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
  Anything that must reach the browser is `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`; anything else
  stays server-side.

---

## 9. When you're stuck

- Read the workspace `AGENTS.md` for the file you're editing — most
  area-specific rules live there, not here.
- Search before you ask: a quick `Grep` for the symbol often surfaces the
  pattern we already use.
- If you find yourself wanting to add a new dependency, framework, or
  pattern that isn't already in the repo, surface it before writing code.
  Takda's stack is deliberately small.
